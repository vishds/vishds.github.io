      <p>
      My name is Vishnu D Sasidharan.
      I've been working in the transportation industry as a software engineer since 2023 (see <a href="./resume.html">resume</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
      I post things I find interesting on this website, mostly for my own reference.

      <h2>Odin's defer differs from Go's defer</h2>
      <p>
        As per the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/defer-panic-and-recover">Go Blog</a>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        A defer statement pushes a function call onto a list.
        The list of saved calls is executed after the surrounding function returns.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Odin's <code>defer</code> implementation is what we (atleast I) expect to happen.
        <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/">Odin's Overview</a> states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        A defer statement defers the execution of a statement until the end of the scope it is in.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        While looking it up to add the hyperlink here, I realised that it directly says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The defer construct in Odin differs from Go’s defer, which is function-exit and relies on a closure stack system.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Media Transfer Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        Devices such as android phones connect with linux via MTP.
        <code>lsusb</code> will recognise these devices, but <code>lsblk</code> will not recognise them as blocks (storage device).
        Additional packages like <code>mtptools</code> are required to transfer data to such devices.
      </p>

      <h2>SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession.add is sync but .delete is async</h2>
      <p>
        This is because delete operation may need to cascade along unloaded relationships,
        It is awaitable to allow for those queries to take place first.
      </p>

      <h2>TCP is much more complicated than I assumed</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://blog.netherlabs.nl/articles/2009/01/18/the-ultimate-so_linger-page-or-why-is-my-tcp-not-reliable">The ultimate SO_LINGER page, or: why is my tcp not reliable</a>

      <h2>Go has a built-in println</h2>
      <p>
        Go has a println method built into the runtime, mostly implemented by the language developers for themselves.
        It is not guaranteed to stay in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it does make the helloworld shorter:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">package</span> main

<span class="kw">func</span> main() {
    <span class="method">println</span>(<span class="str">"heloi"</span>)
}
      </code></pre>
